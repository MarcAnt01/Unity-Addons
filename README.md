# Unity-Addons
Repository of Addons for [Unity Installer](https://github.com/Zackptg5/Unity).

## Usage
- In the root of your unity installer zip, make an `addon` folder
- Copy the addons of choice from this repo into the created addon folder (Ex: `addon/Volume-Key-Selector`)
- Read the README in each repo addon folder to understand its purpose
- Don't delete or modify anything in the addon folder unless the readme states otherwise
- Note that you can compress the addon folder into a tar.xz file to save space.

To compress to a tar.xz file, you can use the command `tar -xJf addon.tar.xz addon` from terminal or if using Windows, install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) and compress the folder to addon.tar and then compress addon.tar to addon.tar.xz with ultra compression.
